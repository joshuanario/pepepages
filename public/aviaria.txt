    Once upon a time in the land of Aviaria, there lived a knight and a sorceress, who warded evil off the land. From the legends of Satan's Armpit to the lore of Gumdrop Tree Forest, they settled in the land to tame a steed of fur who claims to be known as Honeyburr.  A tenacious hunter, Honeyburr purged out the wicked grackles that plauged the land, and emancipated the gregarious herd of Gummybear.  With the adorable rabbit herd roaming free, the mystical veil of fog lifted off to reveal a whimsical place of magic, Piney Land.  Behold, flying high, adorned in feathers of power, King of the Pines perched atop the canopy.  The glorious beast for a majesty recruited the aid of the knight and the sorceress to end his majesty's rivalry against the vile ilk of squirrels.  None amongst Aviaria stood a chance, but the knight and sorceress took the chance.  Filled with vim, the sorceress summoned a fish filled with flames.  The fish spoke, "I am Botard.  I live to serve." The fire fish was dispatched against the rodent brood.  Sacrifice!  Flames erupted and the rodents were incinerated.  Durrwin, the bird witness, spread the news throughout the kingdom. Mourning sorrowfully, hope seemed lost.  Durrwin commited suicide.  Alas, a monster rose up that nourished from the mass grieving.  A three-eyed dog belonging to an ogre, Sir Douchebag, ravaged the Aviarian domain.  Battle!  The knight raised an army and took up arms against Sir Douchebag.  Victorious, the knight and sorceress reigned over Piney Land with the authority granted by the King of the Pines.  Harmoniously they all lived happily ever after.
